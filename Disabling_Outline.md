# Disabling the outline in Xtext
There are several explanations on how to modify the outline view for your language, for example in the official [documentation](https://eclipse.org/Xtext/documentation/310_eclipse_support.html#outline).

Disabling the outline could sometimes be desired, as with very large files it takes very long to compute and the editor freezes.

## Dropping complete support
The first way to do this could be to drop the whole support for the outline. Therefore you can just override the binding to `IContentOutlinePage` in the `UiModule`by adding this snippet
```
override Class<? extends IContentOutlinePage> bindIContentOutlinePage() {
	return null;
}
```

But with this overridden binding the outline is gone for every file of your language, not only for the large ones. 

## Dropping the support for some files
If you want to drop the support of the outline just for very large files, you can override the method `createRoot` of the `OutlineTreeProvider`. In our example the outline should be disabled for files which have more than 10000 lines of code.

The snippet we need to add is the following one:
```
override createRoot(IXtextDocument document) {
    if(document.numberOfLines<10_000){
        super.createRoot(document)
    }
}
```

The method `createRoot` which triggers the creation of the outline is now only called, if the document has less than 10000 lines.
